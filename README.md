# AI-Powered Football Video Analysis System

A computer vision pipeline using **YOLOv8**, **object tracking**, and advanced analytics to extract insights from football match footage. This project detects players, referees, and the ball, and analyzes their movements, speeds, team assignments, and ball possession.

##  Key Features

| Feature               | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
|  Player Tracking     | YOLOv8 + ByteTrack used for ID-level tracking |
|  Ball Possession     | Assigned based on proximity of players to ball |
|  Team Identification | KMeans color clustering from jerseys |
|  Speed & Distance    | Calculated using frame rate and perspective mapping |
|  Accuracy Evaluation | Measures consistency of tracking and labeling |
|  Visual Overlays     | Draws player ellipses, team color, possession arrows, etc. |

##  Dataset Used

- **Source:** [Roboflow Universe - Football Players Detection](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-jvuqo/football-players-detection-3zvbc/dataset/1)
- Contains labeled images of `player`, `referee`, and `ball`
- Used to train a custom YOLOv8 model for this project

---

##  Model Training

Model training was performed using Google Colab:  
➡️ [Open Training Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lTmvPfDC65MEhIXXx2zfsZkPe20_jD8G?usp=sharing)

- Framework: YOLOv8
- Classes: player, referee, ball
- Weights: `best.pt`, `last.pt` (excluded from repo due to size)

---

##  How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Add necessary assets manually:**
   - `models/best.pt` (YOLOv8 weights)
   - `input_videos/Clip1.mp4` (your match video)

4. **Run the pipeline**
```bash
python main.py
```

5. **Evaluate accuracy**
```bash
python evaluate_accuracy/evaluate_accuracy.py
```

---

##  Accuracy Metrics Output

- **Ball Possession Accuracy:** `100.0%`
- **Player Tracking Consistency:** `60.6%`
- **Team Assignment Accuracy:** `97.8%`

Two visuals are also generated:
- `evaluation_accuracy_summary.png`
- `player_visibility_chart.png`

---

##  Notes

- Input/output videos and model weights are excluded due to GitHub's 25MB limit.
- The dataset is publicly available and the training notebook can reproduce the model.
